# MD2FTML

JavaScript toolkits that lets you convert Markdown to FTML.

## Introduction

### What is FTML?

**Foundation Text Markup Language** (FTML) is a term used in SCP Wiki community
and other wikidot sites influenced by it. FTML is the same thing as
what's called Wikidot Syntax, a markup language similar to markdown
but only used on wikidot sites.

### Why MD2FTML?

Markdown is the world's most popular markup language with excellent
readability and portability. People love markdown, but wikidot users
cannot use it when writing wiki pages. So I create a tool that lets
me and other markdown lovers write in our favorite languages
and make our works portable, no need to re-format them when posting to
other platforms.
